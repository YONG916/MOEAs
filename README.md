# MOEAs For BSS Charging Schedule Problem

## Geatpy

1. Install geatpy: 

   ```python
   pip install geatpy
   ```

> [Github Link](https://github.com/geatpy-dev/geatpy)

2. The geatpy needs to define **My Problem.py**.

3. I change some code in **geatpy Algorithm.py** to: 

   - Output the pictures of iterationï¼Œ 

     > 

   - Record the evaluations (GD, IGD, HV, SP)  and number of feasible solutions as .csv table.

     > 

4.  NSGA-II, NSGA-III and RVEA are designed in geatpy; MOPSO is designed in  my project **model1.py**. 

    

   ## Datasets

   Random setting: 20 EVs, 5 BSSs , 3 Batteries at each BSS.
